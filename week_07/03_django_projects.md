# Django Project Week

Potential projects to pick from.

* (1) Polls App
* (2) Djitter

---

## 🗳 (1) _Initiation_ - The Django Polls App
Build out a client-facing webapp by following [the official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/).
This is a great way to learn some functionality, get practice working with Django, as well as learning to get more friendly with reading the extensive and very helpful Django documentation. Example [here](https://github.com/martin-martin/django-polls).


## 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 (2) _Cloning..._ - Djitter, a Twitter clone in Django
Following the tutorial (with some gotchas I found while working through it) allows everyone to build out a second client-facing webapp that utilizes advanced functionality such as user sign-up, and a basic CMS. Code and commits available [here](https://github.com/martin-martin/django-twitter-clone).
