* (4) Scrum Board REST API

## ü¶â Lightweight Django
Using `django-admin startproject <name>` creates an initally intimidating file structure and tons of code.

But Django doesn't _need_ all of that to work. In this project you can build a one-file Django app (see `django_unchained.pdf`).

### Digression: Project-Templates and Virtual Environments
This simple Django file can be transformed into a project template that can be run in the same way as we run `startproject`.

However: This is only working when using an older version of Django (1.8.13) so beware the importance of Virtual Environments!

## üéµ Django REST API
Building out a REST API using Django and [Django-REST-Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
Build a simple Music API according to [here](https://github.com/martin-martin/django-music-API).

## üó≥ API-ify Polls
Extend the polls app you built earlier with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to make it accessible as a REST API.
For help, follow the steps in these two articles:
* [Serializers and Deserializers](https://chrisbartos.com/lesson-1-django-rest-framework-serializers-and-deserializers/)
* [Endpoints](https://chrisbartos.com/lesson-2-django-rest-framework-endpoints/).

## üèÇ Scrum Django REST API
Building out a more complex REST API using DRF. This one should include all functionality that we would expect from a solid REST API.
Code is available [here](https://github.com/martin-martin/django-scrum-API)
