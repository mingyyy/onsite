DJANGO USER AUTHENTICATION
==========================

1) What is the difference between authentication and login?
login is for existing users once we authenticated while authentication is to verify the user info.
:
what we can do with form
1. render form template
2. save to DB

form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
1). save to DB --> new user
2). authentication is to verify the user before we login the user (username, password)
3). login(request, UserObject(already authenticated))

2) Why do we need a POST request for user auth?
we need to send user's username and password; GET only retrieve data

3) What's the advantage for using Django for authentication?
security feature and easy application

4) How did we write the authentication for users
new_user = authenticate(request(user =  , password = password1))

EXTRA TWIST: YOUR QUESTIONS
===========================

5) Arno: How do you make sure you pass a variable (e.g. topic_id) to
	be taken into the next function?
pass it to a dictionary "called context" and take it in render(request, 'filename.html', context)
in html page, {% url 'app_name: path_name' argument(pass to the function) %}
in views, def function(request, argument(e.g. topic.id))

6) Melissa: What is the difference between reverse() and HttpResponseRedirect?
- HttpResponseRedirect is a class imported from django.http, while reverse() method is imported form django.urls module.

- HttpResponseRedirect is to get a string input ( a url) and redirect to that url, make a GET request.
On the other hand, reverse() returns the url given the namespace of the path e.g."logs:index", probably some

- render() method is a method imported from django.shortcuts, which sending a template and transform it into a new HTML file.
approximately **translating.


8) Ming: In HTML file what do we need to do for improving security?
inside a form, crosssite forgery attack
{% csrf_token %}

10) Daniel: How does authentication work?
In django authentication came from the django.contrib.auth module, sending user information

11) Michael: What are the form fields and how do they come into existence?
forms.ModelForm came from django predefined model forms which makes setting the fields easier.
If we are not using the ModelForm, we have more work to define the fields in detail.

12) Blake: What would be the first place to look when Django returns 
		an error?
read the error message page and the python console to understand the errors.
