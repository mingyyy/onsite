DJANGO FORM INPUT
=================

1) What HTML element do we need to collect user input?
form

2) Where can we define what HTTP method the user input will be sent with?
in <form> attribute the the http method = 'GET'

3) How can we check which HTTP request brought us to a function in views.py?
in forms.py if request.method != 'POST' checks if it is POST or not

4) What class do we inherit from when we want to create a Form class from an
existing model?
models.ModelForm

5) Explain the namespace for apps and URL paths and why this whole thing is important
To define the namespace, we have to do two things:
1. we define app_name in setting.py
2. when we define the path in urls.py, the third parameter is the name of your choice which
will be used in hrefs

6) Why do we want to use a HttpResponseRedirect() after submitting a form?
display the content of the form.

7) On a high-level, what is reverse() about?
imported from django.urls module. reverse() takes in app.namespace and returns a url for HttpResponseRedire()

8) Which file to look into if you get a NoReverseMatch error?
urls.py of your app, where we set the namespace

9) How can we display a form inside of our template?
