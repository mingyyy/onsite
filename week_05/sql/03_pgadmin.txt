Using pgadmin:

- Create a new database named car_dealership
- create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

- create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


- create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

- create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

- populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

- Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

    - select all records from users
    SELECT * FROM users;


    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"
    SELECT * FROM cars WHERE make = 'Toyota';


    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car
   SELECT users.first_name, cars.model FROM users_cars AS uc JOIN cars ON uc.car_id = cars.id
   JOIN users ON users.id = uc.user_id;

    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car
    SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name FROM users_cars AS uc JOIN cars ON uc.car_id = cars.id
   JOIN users ON users.id = uc.user_id WHERE cars.color = 'red';


    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table.
    INSERT INTO public.users (id, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES (7, 'Sarah', 'Parker')

    INSERT INTO public.cars (id, make, model, color, year)
    VALUES (9, 'Toyota', 'land cruiser', 'white', 2018)


    INSERT INTO public.users_cars (id, user_id, car_id)
    VALUES (10, 7, 9)

    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table
    UPDATE cars SET color = 'papaya red' WHERE id = 5;

    - delete one record from the database
   DELETE FROM users_cars WHERE id = 7;
